## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was a fun and simple project, the layout was really easy to put together. I was already familiar with the functionality, it reminded me of Base Apparel project. So I didn't specifically learn anything new, but I definitely practiced a lot of things from the last project, specifically `clamp()`. I'm really excited about the new functions and properties that CSS is coming up with. I can't wait for `subgrid` to be available on all the browsers, so we can build layouts more easily.
